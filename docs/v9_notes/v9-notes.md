# v9: plays and looks like a game (notes)

Plan: `~/.claude/plans/wiggly-herding-koala.md` (M0-M10). Each milestone: tests, before/after captures, `--bench-shots`,
a workbook sheet, a commit.

## M0: audit + measurement harness (done)
- Snapshot commit of the v5-v8 work (`138163d`).
- `--bench-shots FILE` (`src/app/BenchShots.cpp`): 5 fixed shots x day (10:30) / night (23:00), the interactive frame
  (stepSim + updateGameCamera, renderFrame + HUD, stepVision, present), CPU phases, GPU passes (GpuTimer), draws, triangles.
- `--input-script FILE --frames DIR` (`src/scene/InputScript.{h,cpp}`, played by `App::runScript`): timed keys, buttons,
  mouse looks, pointer, `shot`, `log`, `quit`. The loop's held-key / button / cursor queries go through `keyDown`,
  `mouseDown`, `cursorPos`, so a script drives exactly the paths a player does. Tests T330, T331.
- `--vsync 0|1`.
- Workbook: sheet 28 "v8 Daylight & Barracks" (v8 was missing) and 29 "v9 Audit & Budget".

### Findings (evidence in `audit/` and `m0/`)
| | |
|---|---|
| Live 20 fps | `stall_vsync1.log`: swap 87.6 ms of a 95 ms frame (sim 2.2, render 2.5, vision 2.6 ms) -> 10 fps; `stall_vsync0.log`: 84.8 fps. The blocking vsync swap under the compositor is the cause. |
| Fixed shots, exe, vsync 0 | 80-101 fps on all 10 shot x time combinations (`audit/bench_shots_m0_win.json.md`) |
| Fixed shots, WSL d3d12 | 54-73 fps (`audit/bench_shots_m0_wsl.json.md`); CPU sim + UAV cameras 6-10 ms on that path |
| GPU | scene pass ~6.5 ms of ~11 ms; 6.3-7.7 M triangles (grass blades, no LOD) |
| Controls | variable dt, linear accel (2 m/s^2), jump only on the press frame, exponential camera ease (see plan) |
| WASD in the exe | `wasd.log`: W 2 s moved the soldier 2.3 m (speed 0.77 m/s: the slow ramp) |

## M1: fixed tick, render interpolation, frame pacing, vision worker, grass LOD (done)
- `scene/TickInterp.{h,cpp}`: `FixedStepClock` (60 Hz, max 4 ticks / frame), `blendTickWorld`, `blendTickPose`.
  `Scene::captureTick / interpolate / restoreTick` blend the drawn leaves between the last two ticks; the camera pose
  is captured per tick (`App::captureTickPose`) and interpolated (`viewOverride_` in `composeView`).
- Frame pacing: swap interval 0 + deadline limiter at the display refresh (`app/FramePacer.cpp`, Windows
  high-resolution waitable timer); `--fps-limit N`, `--vsync 1` to opt in.
- UAV vision: `vision/VisionWorker.{h,cpp}` runs sensor model + CV + v4 tracker on a thread; images are read back
  behind a fence (`RenderTarget::readReady`) and the results join at the next tick start. `--trace` seed 7 60 s with
  `TS_VISION_THREAD=0/1`: byte-identical (`m1/trace_compare.txt`); T334.
- Day fog: half the march steps and no lamp-halo loop by day (1.65 -> 0.56 ms); night halos every other step.
- Grass: 5-triangle curved strip (was the 12-triangle cube), cell prefix submission + per-blade rank LOD.
- Window title FPS used the clamped dt (overstated slow frames): now real time.
- Exe, 1080p EPIC, vsync off: 86-121 fps on the 10 fixed shots (M0: 80-101), grass <= 1.82 M triangles.
- Live loop (orbit noon): 10.4 fps (vsync 1) -> 85.7 fps (100 Hz limiter).
- Open: the night forest is SSIM 0.969 vs v8 (the strip blades read slightly darker than the cube blades); M6 redoes
  grass with a night-parity check. uav_chase night 86 fps (< 90): M9 performance pass.
